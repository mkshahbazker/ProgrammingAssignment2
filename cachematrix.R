## The objective of this code is to:
## cache potentially time-consuming computations

## This function is for Caching the Inverse of a Matrix

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  
}


## This function is for returning a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
  ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
